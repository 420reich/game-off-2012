# FightCode

FightCode has only three rules:

* We don't talk about FightCode;
* If this is your first access you have to fight;
* We don't talk about FightCode.

Well, copyright issues apart, we are all about hacker skills. Code the best
robot you can using our JRA(Javascript Robotic API)® and kick everyone's
robot's asses (not sure if they have those).

## How do I begin?

Head to http://fightcodegame.com and create your first robot. You'll need to
sign in with your github account.

Every single robot you create is created as a Github Gist. This serves several
purposes:

* It allows for automatic revisions of your robot when you change it;
* It is a git repo, so if you'd rather code your robot in your favorite editor, go for it;
* It is SO FREAKING AWESOME.

## The JRA

Please check the docs in the website to learn more about creating robots.

## The People

Behind this awesome project are:

* Bernardo Heynemann;
* Cezar Sá;
* Fábio Costa;
* Guilherme Souza;
* Marcela Abbade;
* Rafael Carício;

## Why?

This is our entry in the Github Game-Off 2012.

## Are you stopping after the contest?

Of course not! FightCode will live on for many seasons to come. You can expect
a LOT of new stuff down the pipe.
